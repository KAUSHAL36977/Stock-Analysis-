# Stock Analysis Bot

This is a Python-based stock analysis bot that uses historical stock data to calculate various technical indicators like Moving Averages and RSI (Relative Strength Index). It also supports making stock predictions using machine learning models.

## Features
- Download stock data from Yahoo Finance using the `yfinance` library.
- Calculate technical indicators like:
  - Simple Moving Averages (SMA)
  - Relative Strength Index (RSI)
- Visualize stock trends with Matplotlib.
- Predict future stock prices using Linear Regression.
- Set alerts based on technical indicators.

## Requirements

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- pip (Python's package installer)

### Install Dependencies

You can install the required dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install yfinance pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
```

## Setup

### 1. **Download Stock Data**

The bot uses the `yfinance` library to download stock data. Here's how to get stock data for a company (e.g., Apple) over the past 5 years:

```python
import yfinance as yf

# Get stock data for Apple over the past 5 years
stock_data = yf.download('AAPL', period='5y', interval='1d')
print(stock_data.head())
```

### 2. **Preprocessing the Data**

To calculate technical indicators, you can preprocess the data. Here's an example of calculating moving averages:

```python
stock_data['SMA_50'] = stock_data['Close'].rolling(window=50).mean()  # 50-day simple moving average
stock_data['SMA_200'] = stock_data['Close'].rolling(window=200).mean()  # 200-day simple moving average
```

### 3. **Technical Indicators**

#### Calculating the Relative Strength Index (RSI)

The RSI is used to measure if a stock is overbought or oversold. Here's the code to calculate it:

```python
def calculate_RSI(data, window=14):
    delta = data.diff()
    gain = delta.where(delta > 0, 0)
    loss = -delta.where(delta < 0, 0)
    
    avg_gain = gain.rolling(window=window, min_periods=1).mean()
    avg_loss = loss.rolling(window=window, min_periods=1).mean()
    
    rs = avg_gain / avg_loss
    rsi = 100 - (100 / (1 + rs))
    return rsi

stock_data['RSI'] = calculate_RSI(stock_data['Close'])
```

### 4. **Prediction using Linear Regression**

If you want the bot to predict future stock prices, you can use Linear Regression. Here's how to set it up:

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
import numpy as np

# Prepare the data
stock_data['Date'] = stock_data.index
stock_data['Date'] = stock_data['Date'].map(pd.Timestamp.toordinal)

X = stock_data[['Date']]
y = stock_data['Close']

model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X, y)

# Predict stock price for the next day
future_date = np.array([[pd.Timestamp('2025-01-01').toordinal()]])
predicted_price = model.predict(future_date)
print(predicted_price)
```

### 5. **Visualizing the Data**

Use Matplotlib to visualize the stock data, including closing prices and moving averages:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
plt.plot(stock_data['Close'], label='Close Price')
plt.plot(stock_data['SMA_50'], label='50-day Moving Average')
plt.plot(stock_data['SMA_200'], label='200-day Moving Average')
plt.legend()
plt.title('Stock Price with Moving Averages')
plt.show()
```

### 6. **Setting Alerts**

You can set alerts based on conditions like RSI thresholds. For example, you can get an alert when the stock is overbought (RSI > 70) or oversold (RSI < 30):

```python
if stock_data['RSI'][-1] > 70:
    print("Overbought: Time to sell!")
elif stock_data['RSI'][-1] < 30:
    print("Oversold: Time to buy!")
```

### 7. **Scheduling and Automation**

For automation, you can use scheduling libraries like `schedule` or `APScheduler` to run the analysis at regular intervals (e.g., every day after market hours).

## Improving the Bot

- **Add More Indicators**: You can include other technical indicators like MACD, Bollinger Bands, and Average True Range (ATR).
- **Machine Learning**: Implement more complex models like Random Forest, XGBoost, or LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) for better stock predictions.
- **Real-Time Trading**: Integrate with platforms like Alpaca or Robinhood for real-time stock trading based on the analysis.
- **Deployment**: Consider deploying the bot on cloud platforms like AWS or Google Cloud to run it continuously.
